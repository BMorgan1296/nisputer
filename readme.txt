A Raspberry Pi multi-project for Nissan Skylines:

2. A GUI Touchscreen, displaying the ECU information on a Pimoroni Hyperpixel 4.0 screen. Will support error codes.
3. Retrieving GPS data using a GPS Module - TBD which one
4. Connecting to the Australian 4G network and transmitting GPS data to a server
5. A server module which will recieve the limited GPS data and provide a web server to show the information on.
