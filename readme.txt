A Raspberry Pi multi-project for Nissan Skyline and Silvia models. 

Any vehicle which uses the old Nissan Consult protocol should work. The display is custom made, but the GPS tracking should be applicable to any project. Will use TPG's $1/month plan to give access to the cellular network.

Nisputer provides the following:

1. Querying ECU information using Nissan Consult.
2. A GUI Touchscreen, displaying the ECU information on a Pimoroni Hyperpixel 4.0 screen. Will support error codes.
3. Retrieving GPS data using a GPS Module - TBD which module
4. Connecting to the Australian cellular network and transmitting GPS data to a server - TBD which module
5. A server module which will receive the limited GPS data and provide a web server to show the information securely.
